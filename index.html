    <p>This is a non-exhaustive, incomplete list of the projects I've made with <a href="https://javascript30.com/">Wes Bos's Javascript 30</a> course.</p>
    <p>The idea of the course is to use only vanilla Javascript and to get acquainted with the things that modern JS can do without having to resort to frameworks or libraries (looking at you, jQuery).</p>
    <p>Most of the projects below have some dynamic element to them, but a couple are just programmatic exercises. They're up here for completion's sake.</p>
    <p>Speaking of completion's sake, a handful of projects here involve running a server, and since I'm just uploading these as static HTML pages, they don't run properly. They involved things like taking control of the user's webcam and feeding it into a <code>canvas</code> to manipulate it, using Javascript's built-in speech-to-text abilities, and using geolocation. For more info go check out <a href="https://javascript30.com">the course</a> itself.</p>
