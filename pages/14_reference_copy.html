    <h1>Javascript references and copies</h1>
    <p>A bit of fiddling to understand the differences between references and copies in Javascript. Like what happens when you set one variable equal to another and then change that other.</p>
    <p>Like in the array exercises, this one is played out mostly in the <a href="/_src">source code</a>.</p>
    <script>
      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // if you change an original, it doesn't change the copy
      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2); // they're the same
      age = 200;
      console.log(age, age2); // now they're different

      // now...
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Charles', 'Ryan'];
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team); // they're the same

      team[3] = 'Lux';
      // if you console.log(team) here you find that team has been changed, obviously
      // but you also find that players has been changed

      // updating arrays always reference back to the original, even if you're changing the copy

      // to fix this, you have to actually copy the array.
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // or use the ES6 Spread:
      const team3 = [...players];

      // or finally
      const team4 = Array.from(players);

      // This whole behavior applies to objects as well
      const person = {
        name: 'Charles Harries',
        age: '27'
      };

      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99; // doesn't copy, because 'person' doesn't have a number attribute

      // let's make a copy instead:
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 }); // the third argument in .assign() takes new attributes
      console.log

      // Unfortunately this is pretty shallow and will only copy one level deep. I.e.:
      const charles = {
        name: 'Charles',
        age: 27,
        social: {
          twitter: '@charlesharries',
          facebook: 'charlesharries'
        }
      }

      const dev = Object.assign({}, charles);
      // That's great, you can change dev without changing charles...
      // unless you try to change more than one level deep.

      // dev.social.twitter = '@cooldude'
      // >> '@cooldude'
      // charles.social.twitter
      // >> '@cooldude'

      // Oops what happened here?

      // There's a function for doing this called cloneDeep(), which will lead to the expected behaviour,
      // but you won't be using it too much.

      // The poor man's deep clone is:
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(charles));
      // but that's benchmarks very, very poorly.
